This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building production-grade React applications with server-side rendering.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Lucide**: A collection of high-quality SVG icons.
- **Jest & Testing Library**: For unit and component testing to ensure a robust application.

## Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
